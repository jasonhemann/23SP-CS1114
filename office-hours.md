# Tutoring

In addition to my office hours, we also have a crackerjack staff of
tutors available for helping students succeed in this class
specifically. These folk have been chosen for their technical,
pedagogical, and social ability: these are clever folk you should be
able to get along with.

You can find our tutoring hours available on Blackboard, and if that
does not work for you, you can reach out and schedule time.

# Office Hours Location and Format

| Date | Time         | Location                 |
| Tues | 9:00-10:30am | McQuaid Hall 210 / Teams |

Normally I will not check or respond to Teams messages sent outside of
these hours. During this period you can feel free to call or message
if you cannot be in the office.

Otherwise, if these hours do not fit your schedule, please [email
me]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/#contact) for an appointment.
