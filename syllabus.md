## Purpose and Objectives

This syllabus contains policies and expectations I have established
for {{ site.title }}. Please read carefully the entire syllabus before
continuing in this course. I intend for these policies and
expectations to create a productive learning atmosphere for all
students. Unless you are prepared to abide by these policies and
expectations, you risk losing the opportunity to participate further
in the course. Policies and expectations as set forth in this syllabus
may be modified at any time by the course instructor. Notice of such
changes will be made by announcement in class, by written or email
notice, or by changes to this syllabus posted on the course website.

### Revise and Extend

I reserve the right to revise and/extend any part of this syllabus at
any time if I consider it warranted.

### Course Goals

1. Develop problem-solving skills.
2. Develop reasoning and solution design skills.
3. Develop programming skills in a modern computer programming
   language.
4. Develop testing skills to ensure a solution’s correctness
5. Develop program abstraction skills.
6. Develop familiarity with modern computer technology.
7. Reinforce basic mathematics and logic skills
8. Develop computational thinking skills using primitive data,
   compound data, structural recursion, and distributed computing.

### Course Topics (in order)

1. Problem-solving, expressions, functions, and making decisions
2. Problem-solving with fixed-size data
3. Problem-solving with arbitrarily large data
4. Abstraction, generic programming, and objects
5. Distributed Programming

## Contact

The best way to get in contact for personal, private (FERPA, etc)
messages is via my email address
[{{ site.author.emailaddr }}]({{ site.author.email }}). You should expect a
response within 48 hours. You will find that I am faster with
[Piazza](piazza) or our public forums. If I deem it even potentially
useful to others, I will likely anonymize your letter, re-post it on
Piazza, answer it there, and forward you the link.

A great regular way to reach out for help is via our [office
hours]({{ site.baseurl }}/office-hours/).

## Resources 

Our primary textbook will be Marco T. Morazán's [Animated Program
Design](https://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-85091-3). We
will follow it for exercises and also for main thrust of developing a
distributed programming project.

### Ancillary text

[How to Design Programs, 2nd Edition](https://htdp.org/2022-8-7/Book/index.html)

This latter text is freely available online, and you may find it a
useful supplement.

### Midterm & Final Exam

I will ask that you complete this individually. These will check our
learning and you should expect the exams, like the material, to be
cumulative.

### Midterm & Final Project

Working together with other developers is an important skill, and no
large modern software is developed alone or without some interface
with the broader community. You will have the opportunity to work in
groups of no more than four to complete these projects. You are not
bound to the same group you started with. I will assign a grade to the
group. The project is scoped for a group of 2-3 individuals working
together and pair programming. These projects will somewhat build on
the material from class and earlier assignments, but will partly ask
you to design and develop your own real functioning software. 

### Homework Quizzes

I will, throughout the course of the semester, have some more sizable
homework assignments, homework quizzes, that I expect you to complete
and to turn in for credit and grading. These will be important in
ensuring that we are both aligned as to how well you are absorbing the
course content, and as a way to help you in fact keep up with the
material.

You will generally have one week to complete these assignments.

### Tutoring & Validation

I have asked our tutors to be the ones to check you off for small
homework assignments that we are grading for completion. You will have
a date by which to have these completed and to come by and show your
work. You will find this useful, as you will want to be making use of
tutoring resources should you get stuck, or want clarification on a
concept, and I hope you will be able to then demonstrate your
understanding to them.

### Class Participation

Attendance is mandatory and expected; I will expect to take attendance
myself at least until I know everyone’s names by heart, which usually
takes some time. I expect that you will attend every class, arrive on
time for a prompt start, and participate in and contribute to class.
If you have some reason to not be in class---academic, health, other,
you must let the course staff know ahead of time. Attendance is
necessary, but not sufficient, for participation in class. Your
participation in our class activities and discussions is important for
your own learning as well as the learning of others. Participation can
take the form of answering questions, asking questions, demonstrating
solutions to in-class assignments, helping a neighbor during
pair-programming exercises, coming to office hours, and many other
forms. I hope that you will feel comfortable enough to ask and answer
questions during class. We will often be using small breakout groups
in class; the expectation is that you will work with your group on the
problem at hand and take turns sharing your findings with the entire
class. Beyond tracking attendance itself, I am keeping a rough track
of highly active and especially inactive students.

### Course Evaluation

Through most of the semester, I am asking you to do work for your own
benefit, and taking the effort to grade it. The university schedules
evaluations for this course---intended to benefit me, your future
colleagues, and the university as a whole---over a time in the
semester in which you have a large amount of work and little time to
do it. I want to make sure it is in your interests too to spend some
of that time providing your candid assessment. I find the qualitative
written feedback to be much more actionable and granular than the
quantitative top-line numbers, but both are valuable. To that end, if
at least 85% of the course submits an evaluation, I will add one GPA
point to the overall course average.

## Technology and Platforms

We will use a variety of tools and platforms to facilitate teaching
and learning over the semester. Please see the [technology page]({{
site.baseurl }}/tech/) for more details.

## Academic Integrity

Cheating refers to copying or submitting as your own, with or without
consent, someone else’s work as your own. Misrepresentation of someone
else’s work as one’s own is a grave violation of academic ethics. This
includes copying from someone else answers to questions during an
examination as well as copying programs from internet sources.
Plagiarism refers to using someone else’s work in your own and not
properly crediting the authors of that work. This includes adapting
someone else’s code to solve a problem or write a program. There will
be no tolerance for cheating and plagiarism in this course. Any
material that is not entirely your own work needs to be properly
indicated and cited. This includes any work produced together with
fellow students. You MUST indicate any sources of help outside of the
course text(s) and your own work, including the names of students with
whom you worked, internet resources or other sources of help. Failure
to do so constitutes a violation of academic integrity. When in doubt,
ask your instructor. Violations of academic integrity will lead to a
score of zero on the offending assignment and likely an immediately
failing grade for the course.

## DSS

It is the policy and practice of Seton Hall University to promote
inclusive learning environments. If you have a documented disability
you may be eligible for reasonable accommodations in compliance with
University policy, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act, and/or the New Jersey Law against
Discrimination. Please note, students are not permitted to negotiate
accommodations directly with professors. To request accommodations or
assistance, please self-identify with the Office for Disability
Support Services (DSS), Duffy Hall, Room 67 at the beginning of the
semester. For more information or to register for services, contact
DSS at (973) 313-6003 or by [e-mail](mailto:DSS@shu.edu), or visit
their [webpage](https://www.shu.edu/disability-support-services/index.cfm).
